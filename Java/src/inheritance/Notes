Inheritance in Java

Keywords to implement Inheritance (Extends and Implements)

When a sub class is inheriting the properties of a super class OR child class inheriting the properties of parent class this is call Inheritance.
In Selenium Web Driver scripting we use Inheritance in a way that we put the common scripts like (opening browser, closing,maximizing etc) into a common class then we use these properties of common class where needed with other classes.
Single inheritance is when a Sub Class access members of parent class, Multiple inheritance is when member of a sub sub class access the members 
When a parent class have more then one classes it become hierarichal inheritance.
